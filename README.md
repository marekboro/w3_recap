# w3_recap
recap of the github usage

Editing file via the GitHub online editor

My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!

The file as well as the dir was copied using 'git clone https://github.com/marekboro/w3_recap.git' 

I shall now try to synch it locally and then on GitHub via the terminal

It worked, lets do this again :) using 'git push'
UNLIMITED POWAAAH

Ok so this will be the 3rd time today that I do this and will go back to Python and HTML/CSS recapping for later.
